# Class 02 Reading Notes

*Continue Intro to HTML*  
1\. It is important to use semantic elements in our HTML because it helps us or another person looking at our code to understand whats going on and what those elements do  
2\. There are 6 levels of Heading  
3\. sup and sub elements are used for subscripting and superscripting, like chemical formulas or to the power of in math  
4\. abbr is for abbreviation or acronym, title must be added for the full expansion of the term  

*Learn CSS*  
1\. Can apply css to html via external stylesheet, internal, or inline  
2\. We should avoid inline styles because it is the least efficient, mixes html and css code (making it harder to read), and just generally makes it look sloppy/unprofessional  
3\.  
    1\. The selector is h2  
    2\. declarations are basically h2 {}, declares that h2 will get these following properties  
    3\. the properties are things like color: or padding:  

*Learn JS*  
1\. A string  
2\. 4 types of JS operators: add, subtract, assign, equal  
3\. A real world problem you could solve with a function is if someone clicks a button called *request quote* for example then your code can easily call out a reusable function named like *calcQuote()* or something that basically figures out how much the quote would be for the end user  

*Making Decisions in your Code*  
1\. An if statement checks a *variable* and if it evaluates to *true* then the code block will execute  
2\. The use of an else if is if you need to run the variable through another set of parameters for a different outcome  
3\. 3 types of comparison operators: equal to, greater than, less than  
4\. One evaluates if both are true, one evaluates if one or the other is true
