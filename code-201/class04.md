# Class 04 Reading Notes

*Learn HTML, Creating Hyperlinks*  
1\. a element and then using the href attribute  
2\. the href attribute contains the web address  
3\. we can use clear link wording, and wording like *click here* to download instead of *download thing*  

*CSS Layout*  
1\. normal flow means the way the webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout  
2\. block level elements take up the entire width of their parent, so they would be viewed on individual lines vs inline elements take up just the width they need to show the content and then you can view another inline element in the same line. Block elements always take a new line all to themselves, inline elements only take a new line when there isn't any room left on the current line.  
3\. Static positioning  
4\. absolute positioning means it sits on its own layer separate from everything else, so it allows us to create isolated UI features that don't interfere with other elements of the page: pop-up info boxes, control menus, rollover panels  
5\. The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)): whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport  

*Learn JS*  
1\. declaration means you're making the function, telling the code it exists, whereas invoking it means you're calling it out to do its job.  
2\. From my understanding they mean the same thing  

*Miscellaneous*  
1\. Learning from fellow students would help me not only solidify my own ideas by verbally explaining them (which it has been shown that when you teach someone something you know, it makes you more knowledgable in it), but if I need help it will allow me to see an approach someone else takes to the problem, creating me a more well rounded individual.  Greater efficiency is also cool, I can see this being a thing in work. It would help me for sure if I don't have to look things up and just focus on the coding
