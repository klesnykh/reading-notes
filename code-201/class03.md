# Class 03 Reading Notes

*Learn HTML*  
1\. You should use an unordered list in your doc when you don't care about a certain order, like if it can be bullet points  
2\. You can change the style of an unordered list by integrating css, and you can also use attributes like circle, disc, square  
3\. Same as question 1, you use an ordered list when you care about the order of the list  

*Learn CSS, the Box Model*  
1\. The padding is like the just in case foam you need in your box to keep the contents safe. Margin is like the shelves in your garage to hold your boxes but to keep them from touching each other  
2\. Four parts of a box:

- context box - this is the box that holds the content
- padding box - this is the extra white space outside the content
- border box - this is the box that wraps the content and any padding, its the border
- margin box - this is the white space outside the border

*Learn JS*  
1\. you can store strings, numbers, objects and even other arrays in an array  
2\. looks correct, should be able to access the stores values by writing people\[list spot in the whole array here]\[list spot in the array you mentioned here]  
3\. Shorthand just means writing the long operator shorter, like making x=x+1 into x+=1. (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, etc.)  
4\. false=0 and true=1, so the output would be 10dog  
5\. Theres tons of conditionals in the real world, even without js. In a js program one example could be if a character chosen in a game is a girl or a boy then you change the look of the character  
6\. An example of a useful loop is asking for a number and you keep looping it until the uder enters a number
