# Class 10 Reading Notes

*Troubleshooting JS*  
1\. Syntax errors are just spelling errors, but if you have a logic error your logic was off on what you thought would happen but the code did everything it was supposed to  
2\. I've had syntax errors where I've misspelled something and it showed me what line I messed up at, easy fix. I've had logic errors too, where I forgot to add something to my code completely and I was almost ripping my hair out trying to figure out why it wasn't working the way I wanted it to  
3\. It's important to know how you messed up so you can fix it easier  

*JS Debugger*  
1\. Basically something you can access on any website, and if you use it on your own you can check out what your page is doing and why by just clicking on the part of your page you want to check out and it lets you know what part of your code affects it  
2\. Its something you can toggle so that code doesn't run, helps you determine what that line of code was doing or how you can manipulate it to change how it looks on your page  
3\. a call stack shows you what code has already been executed
