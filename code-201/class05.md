# Class 05 Reading Notes

*HTML Media*  
1\. A real world use would be if a visually impaired person uses your site and can't see the picture, they would read a good description of it instead  
2\. You can improve the visibility of an image by selecting the correct image type (.jpg, .png, etc), and providing alt text and captions  
3\. When you want to not only change attributes of the picture but also want to provide maybe another alternate meaning to the picture for everyone to understand whats going on better, not just the visually impaired.  
4\. GIF is meant more for animated images and svg is meant more for diagrams/icons. Svg is just coded to tell the browser how to draw it, and so different browesers can show the same svg differently, but gifs, show the same moving picture  
5\. PNG would be the best because its the best for images with not a lot of color data and you want to make sure the quality won't be comprimised because you might have small text that needs to be crisp.  

*Learn CSS*  
1\. Foreground means stuff like text color, vs background is the page color  
2\. You can change a bunch of things to give his blog some life/color: text size, font, can choose a variety of colors, can change the background color, can change the box colors and can even soften the corners of those boxes  
3\. Things to consider: readability, browser support, general aesthetic of the page  
4\. style turns italics on or off, weight sets how bold the text is, and size is self explanatory  
 5\. You can use css to change the letter spacing by using letter-spacing:'' or change the word spacing the same way
