# Class 08 Reading Notes

*Learn Flexbox*  
1\. One dimention just means basically one direction. Like if you wanted to lay out 3 buttons inside a header left to right. An example of 2 dimentions is basically two directions, like a grid, which has ros and columns  
2\. Main axis is left to right, cros axis is top to bottom  
3\. They might make things look good visually, but the functionality of those things would remain what it was before. The example made was using the row reverse and then tabbing between the options. Usually people would be used to tabbing left to right, but the row reverse makes the tabbing go right to left, so that would detriment accessibility  

*Layout - Flexbox*  
1\. It allows you to do pretty much anything to the blocks you want to modify with much more ease  
2\. It will make it easier to finish these courses with any css work
