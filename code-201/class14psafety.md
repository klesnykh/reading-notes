# Class 14: Psychological Safety

1\. Members that listen to one another, show sensitivity to feelings and show sensitivity to needs  
2\. I am part of teens ministry at my church. I serve there as a leader among many other leaders. For the most part we are able to all be ourselves. During the meetings we are able to say what we liked, it was encouraged to say what we didn't like, and so everyone speaks up! Its cool to see it play out in real person. If theres a problem, all solutions are encouraged (they even tolerate my dark humour) and usually the solution to a problem ends up being a different persons idea every time, or a combination of ideas. I love being a part of this team, we meet every tuesday and sometimes fridays/sundays  
3\. That company will be more friendly, more open to everyone. Team members will feel more at home, will have less stress, and might even love work!
