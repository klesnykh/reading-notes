# Class 07 Reading Notes

*Domain Modeling*  
1\. Because it you can create your own "language" to use so that both business teams and developer teams can communicate without confusing each other  

*HTML Basics*  
1\. They reduce accessibility, make the code harder to write, maintain, debug, and they aren't automatically responsive  
2\. tr, td, and th. tr is table row, td is table data, and th is table header  

*Introducing Constructors*  
1\. A constructor is a function that can make objects. The benefit is not needing to create tons of objects and then going through object by object to modify each one if needed  
2\. this in a constructor just returns that key:value pair to the variable the constructor is being assigned to  

*Object Prototypes Using a Constructor*  
use Object.create(put object you want to copy here) to create an object and copy the key:value pairs that object has.  
1\. an easy way to explain it is the copy/paste buttons on a computer. You can copy a template (but in this case the template is a similar object) and then you can change the individual things you want to change in that template. In this case you can change the values that you need to change inside that object. In my work experience this would be like knowing how to do a kitchen remodel, and just copying that kitchen but changing different things in that kitchen to suite the customer
