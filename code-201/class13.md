# Class 13 Reading Notes

1\. We use local storage so that the user can continue where they left off, basically its all for a better user experience  
2\. We shouldn't store user info that could comprimise the user  
3\. Strings, you can work around this by using the native JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods
