# Class 09 Reading Notes

**Functional Programming Concepts**  
1\. A style of building the structure and the elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data  
2\. It's pure if it returns the same result if given the same arguments and does not cause any side effects  
3\. code is easier to test  
4\. cannot be changed after it is created  
5\. when you use both pure functions and immutable data
