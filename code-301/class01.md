# Class 01 Reading Notes

**Component Based Architecture**  
1\. I can copy and paste what the definition is, but I don't understand what it is. What makes sense to me is that a component is an object that interacts with other components in some way  
2\. Characteristics of a component: reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent  
3\. reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components, increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components  

**What is Props and How to Use it in React**  
1\. props is short for properties  
2\. used for passing data from one component to another  
3\. unidirectional flow
