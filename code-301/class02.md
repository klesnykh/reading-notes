# Class 02 Reading Notes

**React Lifecycle**  
1\. render  
2\. the first thing that happens is the constructor of the component  
3\. constructor, render, React updates, componentDidMount, omponentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount  
4\. It plays a part in inserting the component into the DOM  

**React State Vs Props**  
1\. pretty much any JS value  
2\. You pass props into a component and state is handled inside of the component, props are handled outside of the component  
3\. We re render when the user has an input  
4\. Anything that can be updated by the user that you want to store, maybe like a counter or potentially maybe items in a cart? idk
