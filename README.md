## What is a Growth Mindset?

The best, or should I say "easiest" way to explain a growth mindset is just a positive mindset. 

When looking into the different mindsets out there, I've noticed that a lot of the differences between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset sounded like the differences between a positive and negative mindset. For example a fixed mindset ignores criticism. How do we often imagine ourselves or someone else doing this? What phrases pop into our head? One that I can personally think of is "this person doesn't know what they're talking about" or maybe "I know way more than this person, why are they criticising me?". I'm sure many of you can think up countless scenarios. 

Not only is this person being negative, but the thought that didn'toccur to this person is...what if they're wrong? Imagine having a POSITIVE outlook in this scenario. What would that look like? How would you respond? What comes to me is to really think about what I'm being criticised for, if I think there is no merit in this criticism maybe I would be polite and respond with "thank you for bringing this up, I will definitely think about it" and bring it up with someone else that knows me and see if they have any similar criticisms of me. After all if multiple people have the same criticism, maybe there **is** a problem!

Think about any roadblocks you may have in your life that hold you back from getting where you want to go, whether they be in this class or just in life. How can you react positively instead of negatively to these encounters? Once you master your character in that way, you will be in a growth mindset. In the end, a growth mindset is just a being able to take hard/negative things in life and turn them into a learning moment to make yourself better. This can be in many areas: love, joy, peace, patience, etc.

## 3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

  > 1. Take a step/some time away from the problem. 
  >
  >    - Remind yourself this problem helps you be a better person in some way. 
  >    - Every moment is a learning opportunity!
  >    
  > 2. Take time every day to think about bettering yourself, wether that be the Bible, journaling, meditation, yoga, etc. 
  >
  >    - Ask youself the questions listed in the **[Growth Mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)**
  >    
  > 3. Try learning something outside of just work! 
  >
  >    - Preferably something active. The competetive mindset you'll get trying to better yourself in a sport, for example, will give you that edge as well trying to better yourself in other areas of your life. Competetiveness is great if applied correctly
