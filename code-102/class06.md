# Class 06 Notes

## JavaScript Time

- Uses simple functions like python
- object oriented
- runs on the client side of the browser instead of the server side
- can be used on server side too
- turns websites into applications, means user interaction
- you can make functions, helps code be reusable
- you write the logic
- boolean expressions, conditional statements, logic, loops
- can use javascrypt in html the same way you can use css in html
- variables should be declared const, unless you think they might be changed later on, then declare them with let=so and so
- what you name the variable is the identifier
- identifiers are case sensitive
- = is an assignment, not an equal to operator
- this way you can to a line like x = x+5
- == is the operator for equal to
- text is called strings
- creating = declaring a variable
- you can declare and end it there, or assign a value to it right away
- using var to redeclare a variable will allow it to keep its last assigned value if you don't assign a new one
- can't redaclare with let or const
