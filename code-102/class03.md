# [Git Tutorial](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)

- Git is a is a DVCS (I'm sure Ill figure out how this works fully later) that allows users to work together
- the file system is made up of snapshots
- it allows clients to make "mirrored repositories", like data backups
- 3 stages of a file in Git: commited, modified and staged
- If I ever have a question on how git works, how to clone, import, etc. or possible commands to use I can always either google them or refer back to the Git Tutorial
- committing a file: git commit -m "made changes x, y, z"
- using remote repositories allows you to make changes to your project on the github website
- the more you use it, the more familiar you will get with it

- ACP: add, commit, push
- git status tells you what changes you've made
