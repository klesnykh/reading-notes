## CSS Basics

- used to specify how the site looks to users, just the basics
- can write 3 ways
  - inline - css is built into the html element itself
  - internal - css is buit into the html file
  - external - separate css file connected to html
- you're basically writing rules for how the words/pics/videos are displayed on the website
- you can make a css stylesheet with the rules that the elements in the html have to follow, saved with .css extention. Then when you want to add it you need to add link rel="stylesheet" (this says what relationship the link has to this html file, so this specified relationship is stylesheet) href="example.css" (this is the stylesheet file name)
- use [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders) to mess around with different backgrounds and borders
- for css you can set color by using color: "color name" or color: rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla(include numbers separated by commas here)
