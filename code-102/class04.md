## Wireframe

- the practice of creating the heirarchy of how you want your website to run/look/function/layout/interaction

## Mozilla HTML Basics

- \<p> is an opening paragraph tag, a type of element
- \</p> is a closing paragraph tag
- elements sometimes have attributes inside less than/greater than symbols
- Nesting elements have to be open and closed in order
- void elements are used for stuff like embedding picture
- css is for style, html is for structure
- html is the frame of the site
- semantic vs non semantic html elements
- html has 6 heading levels h1-h6
- comments are !-- comment --
- there are unordered and ordered lists
- for ordered list you use ol, and ul for unordered
- items inside the list are written inside a li (list) element
- href is a hypertext reference

## Semantics

- basically what elements are names specifically to let us know what that element does
- you can do the same thing with non semantic wording, but you should use whats easier/quicker
- semantics makes searching through code easier
- [html elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
