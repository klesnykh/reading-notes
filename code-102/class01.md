# Class 01 Reading Assignment

Why does learning markdown and github pages matter? Because to me it seems to be the easiest way to generate webpages, which is the basics of coding, and the teachers here at codefellows wouldn't have us learn it if it didn't serve a purpose for us in the future. I trust them with my future.

- Good idea to bookmark the Mardown Basic Syntax, could come in handy
- Markdown is basically a thing you can use to write HTML websites more easily because
it translates what you wrote from markdown into HTML (from what I understand)
- GitHub Pages allows you to use this "Markdown" tool to make your .md (markdown) files
into an actual website
- All you have to do is follow the directions when writing in markdown format, and the
tool does the rest for you
- In GitHub, all you need to do is make a new repo, make a new .md file that will be 
your main "README" file and then you can make as many files as you want underneath that
you can then link to your README file if you want to do that

It's fairly simple to learn if you take the time to learn about what GitHub is, what
GitHub Pages is, how to use them, etc. Our teacher provided us with links to Markdown
syntax, how to master Markdown on GitHub, and a video on GitHub Pages as well. I can 
give you these rescources if needed.
