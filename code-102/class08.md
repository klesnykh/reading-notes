# Class 08 Notes

## Questions

- how does this whole obj.x thing work if obj is a variable

- *Expressions and Operators*
- Assignment operators just assign value
- comparison operators compare values and return true or false

- *Loops*
- **FOR** - for every time a user imput does so and so, do this

for(\[initialExpression]; \[conditionExpression], \[incrementExpression])
    statement

- 1 - the initialExpression is executed, and can also declare variables
- 2 - the conditionExpression is evaluated and if true the loop (statement in this case) runs, if false it terminates

- **DO-WHILE** - do this while this is true, if false it terminates, always does one action before the while statement, test occurs after the execution

- **WHILE** - executes the loop as long as the condition is true. While it is true, do this
- When false, exits loop, test occurs before the loop
