# Class 07 Notes

- code will run from first line to last unless it meets conditionals/loops
- you cam make functions do whatever you want inside {} given whatever values ()
- function parameters get listed in the () and separated by commas
- functions need to be invoked to execute
- when executed, functions have a return
Example [function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp):

let x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
}

- document.getElementById(id).innerHTML = "new HTML"
- In this line of code in javascript id was the paragraph <\p> in HTML, but when the javascript code runs that line it changes the paragraph <\p> to a new content, in this case the new content would be "new HTML"
- when a variable gets declared inside a function, they cannot be used outside that function
- because of this you can use the same name of that variable in a different function

## Javascrypt Operators

- Arithmetic - anything using addition, subtraction, decrement: +, -, *, **, /, %, ++, --
- Assignment - adds a value to a variable, like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=
- Coparison - equal to, not equal to, etc: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=, ?
- Logical - logical and, logial or, logical not: &&, \|\|, !
- Conditional - condition ? val1 : val2
If condition is true, the operator has the value of val1. Otherwise it has the value of val2. You can use the conditional operator anywhere you would use a standard operator.
- Type - typeof, instanceof
- Bitwise -

- expression - a valid unit of code that resolves to a value
- functions are too hard to understand until you try them
