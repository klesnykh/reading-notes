# Class 33 Reading Notes

**What is Role Based Access Control?**  
1\. it restricts what a user is able to do based on the role they have associated with their account  
2\. As a user of netflix you are granted the role of user, so you are able to read (watch) movies, but you can't add any, delete any, or update any  
3\. It makes sure your app won't get highjacked, will make sure that there is less load on the system by not allowing access when it's not needed, etc.  

**react-cookies component**  
1&2\. Seems like you are able to basically use them in a similar way as using local storage, but it might be faster/better/easier to use  
3\. IDK which library this is talking about, but I assume it has to do with local storage. If react cookies are as simple/easy to use as I think they might be then obviously I'll go with the easier choice
