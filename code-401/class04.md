**noSQL vs SQL**  
1\. SQL  
2\. noSQL  
3\. sql are scalable by increasing/upgrading the computer components like RAM, noSQL is scalable by using more servers(computers)  

**SQL Modeling Techniques**  
1\. its where an entry in one table is related to more than one entry in another, they're usually related by a key, the example they give was a department for employees  
2\. create a diagram  
3\. primary key is the one that is unique to that table, foreign key matches the primary key in another table  

**Video**  
1\. keywords have significance and are usually used as identifiers such as table and column names, the parameters are for the values in those columns  
2\. its the optimization of tables that uses schemas to filter out the data to eventually make every table have a sole purpose or topic  
3\. one to one means a key in one table matches only one key in another, one to many is the same thing but matches to many keys in another table, and many to many just means there are multiple of the same key in one and they match to multiple of that key in another table
