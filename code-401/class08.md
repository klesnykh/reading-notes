# Class 08 Reading Notes

**5 Steps to RBAC**  
1\. It's the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important because it is an added layer of security, which prevents access through employees credentials when that employee didn't even need all of that access in the first place, and one that would need that access would be more careful (hopefully)  
2\. Grunt work (only needs access to clock in/out and the name of the customer to log for what he's working), estimating/sales and/or project management(needs customer name, email, address), tax/payroll (needs employee details, deposit/expense details), and small company owner (details on everything)  
3\. Figure out how many sytems I have, what kind of data my workforce needs access to, assign people to roles and give accessibility based on those roles, never make a one-off change for a different access rating for any employee with unusual needs, and audit accessibility periodically  

**wiki - RBAC**  
1\. Are you allowed to see the things you want to see?  
2\. role assignment, role authorization, permission authorization  
3\. you wont have employees that have access to what they shouldn't have access to
