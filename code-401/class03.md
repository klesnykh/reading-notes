# Class 03 Reading Notes

**Review: ES6 Classes**  
1\. objects  
2\. you cannot use a class before it is declared  
3\. a constructor is basically the mold to create an object, its the thing you use to construct said object. "this" allows you to specify the attributes of this object, like "this rectangles (which is the object) height is so and so"  

**Using Express Routing**  
1\. How an apps endpoints respond to client requests  
2\. path is what the url on the site would have after the forward slash, which defines the endpoints at which requests can be made. Methods are what to do with those requests like get, update, delete, etc.  
3\. You need next when you have more than one thing you're going to be doing to the request/response and have potentially more than one callback function, then you'll neet to call next() in the middleware in order to have it continue onto the next callback function  

**Express Routing**  
1\. no clue what this means, but apparently it is like a mini-express app that provides us with routing API's  
2\. It just opens the gateway to using express routes, you can't route without it  
3\. To do something before a request is processed
