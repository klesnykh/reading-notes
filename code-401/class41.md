# Class 41 Reading Notes

**Getting Started with React Native**  
1\. View is probably the most used container/core component, it supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.  
Text is another component, it displays, styles and nests strings of text  
Image displays images  
2\. ios and android use native components to build their apps, and react native allows us to use JS to build those apps. We call it native because you use it almost the same way you would use react, but using native components/elements  
3\. Native components I think, different from react for sure because everything you make will boil down to native components whereas react doesn't need native components  

**expo**  
1\. Helps build apps that can run on multiple platforms  
2\. managed workflow  
3\. from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39170622/what-is-the-difference-between-expo-and-react-native): In summary, Expo provides a faster and easier way to get started with building a mobile app, while React Native provides more control and customization.  

**expo snack**  
1\. It allows us to mess around and while showing us a live view. Basically lets us start and learn without starting a new expo app  

**ejecting**  
1\. basically converts your expo app to a react native app  
2\. if you think you'll need to change something up in expo again later, you cannot 'inject' back.  
3\. if you want to add an npm package to the project and you need to install it
