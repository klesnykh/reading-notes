# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the mentality that even if I don't know something I can still learn it. It means that I am in the mindset of getting better, and that even if things arent going the way I want them too that means I'm still getting better. Keeping this mindset is important, because if your mindset fails then everything else falls. It is the foundation of a flexible person who will do good regardless of the circumstances. It is the foundation of getting better, and I want to get better
