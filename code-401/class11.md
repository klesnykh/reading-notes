# Class 11 Reading Notes

**Event Driven Programming**  
1\. EventEmitter  
2\. It means objects can listen to events from other objects, meaning you don't need an object to trigger the next action, but rather the next action gets triggered because it hears the event in the object  
3\. The same way an event listener might hear a click on the front end, event listeners on the backend would only need an event to happen in order to execute without having to specifically be called, so it automates a lot
