# Prep: Engineering Readings

1\. My way of thinking, my way of tackling problems...me  
2\. Try to explain the problem to myself in plain english, see if I have any holes in my logic, reduce the problem down into smaller problems that might be more manageable, ask for help, remember its just a game to help you learn and get better, and worst case scencario scrap and retry
