## Bash Command Line Tutorials

**The Command Line**  
A command line is an interface where you can tell your computer to do certain things that you might not necessarily be able to do through any typical apps/OS. It works by using well known predefined commands that you type in depending on what you want to do and then the computer executes those commands. You can get to it by opening your launch pad and typing in terminal  

**Basic Navigation**
pwd - print working directory  
ls - shows all the files in the folder/directory you're currently in  
you can specify absolute paths by using the / slash, for relative location you just type in the file name  
~ - home directory  
. - a reference to your current directory  
.. - a reference to your parent directory  
cd - to move into a location  
you can use the tab key to autofill  

**More About Files**  
-everything is a file  
-Linux is extentionless, it doesn't need the endings of file names like .jpg, etc.  
-Linux is case sensitive, make sure to name your files/folders exactly what you want them to be  
-still need to care about spaces in file names  
-hidden files start with a .  

**Manual Pages**  
Manual pages explain every command available on your system including what tehy do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept  

**File Manipulation**  
mkdir - make directory (or folder)  
rmdir - remove directory  
touch - make a blank file  
cp - copy a file or directory  
mv - move a file or directroy  
rm - remove a file
