# Class 39 Reading Notes

**Redux Toolkit (RTK)**  
1\. redux stores are complicated to configure, having to add a lot of packages to have Redux do anything useful, needs too much boilerplate code  
2\. provides simplified config options and good defaults to createStore. It automatically combines your slice reducers, adds whatever middleware you supply, incudes thunk by default, and enables the use of the Redux DevTools Extension  
3\. I read it, but I'm not entirely sure what createSlice does. I assume it just creates a slice reducer  

**MobX**  
1\. a state management solution  
2\. it automatically executes code that depends on state  
3\. You gotta make a bunch of stuff "observable", "computed", idk.

1\. this thing is an hour and a half long, I didn't watch it
