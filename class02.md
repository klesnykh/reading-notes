# Choosing a Text Editor
---
*for a non technical friend*
---

- When learning to write code for the first time you run into many text editors. This is a personal choice, one that can make you feel right at home writing code or might end up not being to your liking. Don't be afraid to try many out. Who knows, you might find one that you like more than your current one! The main goal is to be able to successfully write websites to your satisfaction
- A text editor is just a software that allows you to write text, web developers use it to write the text that builds websites
- There are many potential features that you might look for when choosing a text editor. One usually comes with your computer, but you can choose a different one depending what cool features you might be looking for, like:
  - code completion
  - syntax highlighting 
  - themes
  - extentions 

- When using a text editor make sure you're writing in plain text and that there are no options for bold, underline, change sizing, etc. There might be a setting to toggle for this
- create a folder to hold your entire website. As you create more files, keep it organized with folders/subfolders
- Theres a bunch of text editors, but our teachers hooked us up with VS Code

### Diffferent Classifications of Text Editors
**from my understanding, which may be lacking**
- Text Editors just help you edit text
- IDE's are basically an all in one solution: text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger. I think VS Code does this if I'm not mistaken?
- SOftware Developers need to choose what text editors they use carefully, because it will either help them or make them slower and more irritated. You want a text editor that helps you be a better developer, not slow you down

### The Command Line
- Can have many open at a time doing different tasks
- A command line is a text based interface to your computers system
- Most of the time you will be issuing commands
- The shell is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal behaves/loos after doing what you imputted
- There are tons of shortcuts we can learn

### Basic Navigation
- pwd command means print working directory, thats all it can do
- ls command means to show what there is available in the current place you're in, and theres a good amount of options for what you can command alongside it to make it more specific
- absolute/relative paths
  - root is the very top, denoted by a single slash (/)
  - absolute paths specify location based on relation to the root directory, they always begin with a slash
  - relative paths specify a location compared to where you currently are in the system and do not begin with a slash
- cd command means to change location, so to go to desktop you would type cd Desktop
- pressing tab with auto complete what you want to type

### Basic Navigation
- EVERYTHING is a file (including your monitor), that makes it a bit easier to understand
- Linux (and I think Mac) is extentionless, meaning they dont care what the ending of a file name is but just look inside and determine it. Windows does care. Extentions look like .exe, .txt, .jpg and etc
- Linux is case sensitive, and windows is case insensitive
- beware of spaces in file names, in order to make sure commands read files with spaces as a single command you need to use single quotations, or by putting a backslash in front of the spaces because backslashes nullify the meaning of the next character
- hidden files just have an a . at the beginning, you can create hidden files by naming them starting with a .
- you can make a file unhidden by removing the a . in the filename
